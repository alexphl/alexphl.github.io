This is my personal resume website built with Next.js.

# This is a static page. Why Next.js?
Convenience, mostly. I get to keep the workflow consistent with my other projects, which means I can work faster.

Vanilla HTML / JS / CSS don't scale well and I don't plan on this page staying static forever.

With some tweaks, Next trims most of the unnecessary JS and CSS for static deployment, and I'm more than happy with the bundle size for this page.

I still write vanilla CSS for this one though. It's fun, in a way.
